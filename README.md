### Tetris Sudoku

A Game where you have basic Tetris block to fill out a Sudoku grid.
Each time you complete a Row, Column or Block, the Tetris blocks disappear to make space.

You can gain Streaks by completing many Blocks on after another.
Clearing multiple Blocks with one Piece gives extra points.


##### Goal

Reach the highest Score and beat your own Highscore by completing as many blocks as possible.

### Sliding 15

You get a randomly shuffled grid of blocks which have to be rearranged to create the original layout.
One block is missing, so that you can move adjacent blocks to the clear space.

Basic is a 4x4 grid with one piece missing, so 15 blocks randomly shuffled.

## Goal

Recreate the original layout of the Puzzle
