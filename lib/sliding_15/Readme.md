# Sliding

You get a randomly shuffled grid of blocks which have to be rearranged to create the original layout.
One block is missing, so that you can move adjacent blocks to the clear space.

Basic is a 4x4 grid with one piece missing, so 15 blocks randomly shuffled.

## Goal

Recreate the original layout of the Puzzle
